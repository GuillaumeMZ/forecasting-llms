        "As of 2024, there have been over 250 missions to the International Space Station (ISS). Currently, the ISS is expected to be operational until at least 2030, with discussions about extending to 2036 or beyond. \n\nAnnual missions to the ISS typically include crewed expeditions (around 4-6 per year recently) plus cargo resupply missions (~4-6 per year), totaling roughly 8-12 missions per year.\n\nEstimating from 2024 to 2036 is 13 years. Assuming an average of 10 missions per year:\n\n13 years * 10 missions/year = 130 missions\n\nAdding this to the approximate 250 missions that have already flown:\n\n250 + 130 = 380 missions approximately by 2036.\n\n[Answer] 380",

        "As of 2024, a small but increasing number of ships and explorers have successfully navigated the Northwest Passage, mainly due to melting Arctic ice. The passage was first successfully navigated in 1903-1906 by Roald Amundsen. Since then, with climate change and advances in navigation technology, more vessels have made the trip, with annual attempts increasing in recent years.\n\nConsidering current trends, the difficulty and danger remain significant, but accessibility is improving. Annually, around a handful of vessels and expeditions navigate the Passage. Assuming a modest growth in successful transits due to improved conditions and increased interest, the total number by 2036 could be estimated.\n\nAs of now, approximately 100-200 successful complete passages have been recorded (including repeated trips and different vessels) over the last century.\n\nEstimating about 5-10 successful passages per year on average from the present until 2036 (12 years from 2024) adds roughly another 60-120, making the total count approximately 160-320 by 2036.\n\nSelecting a midpoint estimate:\n\n[Answer] 240 N"
